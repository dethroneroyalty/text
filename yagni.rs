// So I had remembered about "X system live for decades because of it's incredible flexibility,
// since philosophy: `Instrument not politics`"
//  ... BUT ....
// Doesn't easier to build more simple and opinionated (and appropriate) software which serve
// (exmp) 5-10 years (LESS feautres, and abilities to add-features/configure), and after time, if
// it doesn't fit, just build NEW software which is MORE APPROPRIATE to new conditions instead
// just try "perelepit" old software ....
// ... someone can say .. but this new software will be not tested/proven/buggy-at-first-time
// BUT ... the gist is SIMPLICITY (not only interface/features but IMPLEMENTATION also) ... soft
// should be simple in implementation and not necessary super-flexible, but of course WITH THE GAP
// TO EXTENSION in SOME degree.
//
// GENERALLY the rule: if agility-in--(interface/features) makes implementation significantly
// complex, it's better eliminate this extesnibility/agility---for---features/extensions

// Fucking pluralizations of names in ORM, and most of all RIGHT pluralization for exceptions.
//
// Fuck that.... Just name models in pluralized way .. problem solved (without any code) ... 
//  ... maybe we can add `toLowerCase` when translate model name to table name ... that NOT TO
//  DIFFICULT (in sense of implementation)
//  ... everything is fucking consistent, no exceptions,
//              YOU TAKE WHAT YOU GIVE, and notghing more...
